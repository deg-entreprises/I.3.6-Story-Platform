## P3 Story Investment Memo

### Purpose
We enable **African Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers** to participate in the future of **Open Source Storytelling**.

### Problem
**Africa's Neutral Alcohol Supply Chain** is modeled after outdated institutions, so **African Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers** are dependent on outdated solutions without the ability to voice how their value chain should mature.

### Solution
**DEG Entreprises** is developing a Parallel Permaculture Platform Ecosystem (P3 Ecosystem) modeled after a **Healthy Eukaryotic Cell**, so **African Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers** can use biomimicry to disrupt **Africa's Neutral Alcohol Supply Chain** with an open source and decentralized story platform.
